### Introduction

This long-term project aims to refurbish and update public housing in the High-rock and Hammerfell areas to modern standards while maintaining the cultural asthetic of the areas.

This includes re-arranging and adding furniture and clutter, adding windows to houses that have none, Placing indoor windows to houses that have exterior windows but no interior windows and general asthetic cleanup.

### Requirements

Daggerfall Unity 13.5+ - [https://github.com/Interkarma/daggerfall-unity](https://github.com/Interkarma/daggerfall-unity)

### Installation

Copy the .dfmod file from the zip to your StreamingAssets/Mods folder.
To use these building overrides, copy the .json files for the buildings into your StreamingAssets/WorldData folder.

### Volunteers Wanted

As this is a huge project I'm looking for help. If anyone wants to overhaul a building and submit the .json file let me know and I can give you access.
